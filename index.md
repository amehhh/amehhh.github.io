Hi!, I am a Ph.D. student in the department of Chemical Engineering, currently conducting research in the Sibley school of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering under [Prof. Samuel Otto](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/sam-otto/) in the [Otto Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/ottolab/home) at Cornell University, New York, USA. Previously, he completed his undegraduate degree under [Dr. Maciej Balajewicz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciejbalajewicz) at the Kazan National Research technological University, Kazan, Russia. My research interests lie at the intersection of **computational fluid dynamics, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and reduced-order modeling** , with the goal of developing efficient methods for the optimal control of high-dimensional nonlinear fluid flows, enabling faster and real time optimization and decision-making.
